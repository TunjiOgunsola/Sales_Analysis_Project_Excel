# Sales_Analysis_Project_Excel
This is 2022 sales report of an industrial cable company. The repository contains raw data of stock record in excel format and the data was also cleaned and analyzed with Ms excel software.
Four (4) excel files was made available for analyis.Each files contains different type and brands of industrial cables. 

The first file is named "GALAXY RECKLINE STOCK" (File 1) which contains the incoming and outgoing stocks of aluminium reckline cables.
Second file is named "AFRIGOLD COPPER STOCK" (File 2)which contains the incoming and outgoing stocks of armoured copper cables.
Third file is named "MARINO COPPER STOCK" (File 3) which contains the incoming and outgoing stocks of armoured copper cables.
The fourth file is named "DELTASIL COPPER STOCK" (File 4) also contains the incoming and outgoing stocks of armoured copper cables.

Each files were cleaned with excel software and some columns such as 'Rate_per_meter','Location',and 'Amount' to each table.
Since file 2,3 and 4 are of same type but diferent brands, they were merged together for convinience. While File 1 was left as stand alone because it does not have type pair.
As a result of data cleaning, two tables were created namely 'Recline Cleaned Data' and 'Copper Cleaned Data'.

Recline cleaned data was analysed to produce another table 'Recline Sales Analysis' which showcase various breakdown of sales and an interactive dashboard.
Copper cleaned data was also analysed to produce another table 'Copper Sales Analysis' which showcase various breakdown of sales by months,brands, size,location,ranking customers and an interactive dashboard.
